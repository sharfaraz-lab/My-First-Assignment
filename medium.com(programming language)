High level languages are nearly human languages which are more complex then the computer understandable language which are called machine language, or low level language
he computer only understands binary language (the language of 0’s and 1’s) also called machine-understandable language or low-level language but the programs we are going to write are in a high-level language which is almost similar to human language.
